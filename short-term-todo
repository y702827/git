* process_entry:
  * create new-unmerged entries for D/F conflicts, and sometimes path
    conflicts (e.g. modify/delete).  Write to both opti->paths and
    opti->unmerged.
  * write still-unmerged entries to opti->unmerged.
* conflict messages need to be printed, usually
* Write code to update index too.


Old stuff, probably delete:
* Do a bunch of clean up to get a nice clean history; store now-unnecessary
  commits in a different branch
* Do I need to record dirmask in conflict_info?
