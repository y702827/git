* Today
  * Computing trees completely wrong; fix it
  * Resolution of files may result in an empty dir; if so, leave the directory
    out rather than recording an empty tree for it.


* Stuff to not forget:
  * Write code to update index too (remove_marked_cache_entries()?  apply.c?)
  * conflict messages need to be printed, usually
  * Normalization code from merge-recursive.c -- modify/delete might actually
    be a not-modified/delete.
  * FIXMEs in checkout()

Old stuff, probably delete:
* Do a bunch of clean up to get a nice clean history; store now-unnecessary
  commits in a different branch
* Do I need to record dirmask in conflict_info?
