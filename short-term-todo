* Today
  * Commit code and pull to laptop before going home
  * Respond to Junio to ask him to actually get v2 of en/unpack-trees-check-updates-simplify
  * See if '-c merge.renames=0' speeds up the reported rebase problem


* Write code to update index too (remove_marked_cache_entries()?  apply.c?)
* conflict messages need to be printed, usually


* Stuff to not forget:
  * Normalization code from merge-recursive.c -- modify/delete might actually
    be a not-modified/delete.

Old stuff, probably delete:
* Do a bunch of clean up to get a nice clean history; store now-unnecessary
  commits in a different branch
* Do I need to record dirmask in conflict_info?
