* conflict messages need to be printed, usually
* Write code to update index too.


* Stuff to not forget:
  * Normalization code from merge-recursive.c -- modify/delete might actually
    be a not-modified/delete.

Old stuff, probably delete:
* Do a bunch of clean up to get a nice clean history; store now-unnecessary
  commits in a different branch
* Do I need to record dirmask in conflict_info?
