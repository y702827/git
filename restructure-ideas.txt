Stuff to nuke
  * Don't need the unpack-trees.[ch] anymore, though
      cdeec536ea (unpack-trees: exit check_updates() early if just doing a dry run, 2019-11-09)
      bfb6cba9ce (unpack-trees: exit check_updates() early if updates not requested, 2017-12-21)
    can both be upstreamed.
  * testit.py obviously wasn't meant for final version just for demonstrating O(N^2)
  * TODO, ort-cover-lettter, and ort-todo, and stuff-missing.txt can be removed

  * throw away merge-ort patches which:
    * change how unpack_trees is called
    * "avoid unnecessary discard and re-read of cache"
    * everything with "*_would_be_overwritten", update_file[_flags], update_working_tree
    * "WIP: towards simple unpack_trees usage"
    * "more merge-ort WIP: now with process_entry()"

Overall structure
  [Note this covers everything through
    "Handle directory renames better in collect_merge_info_callback"
  ]
  * Add strmap.[ch] (how many commits?)
    * Basics like Peff had?
    * Then my new functions (e.g. strmap_for_each_entry, strmap_empty)?
    * Adding in strdup_strings?
  * First two commits creating merge-ort are good
  * collect_merge_info*
    * add plain data structures first
    * add various sanity checks
    * add barebones functions (add to opt->unmerged unconditionally, filemask)
    * slowly add other complications:
      * df_conflicts
      * optimizations
        * all three sides match
        * filemask == 7 && sides_match
        * tracking possible directory rename bases
        * side matches base
